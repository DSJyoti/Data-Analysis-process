# Data Analysis Process
This repository contains a structured approach to data analysis, covering data collection, cleaning, exploration, visualization. Below is an overview of the key steps involved:


1. Data Collection
Gathering data from multiple sources (CSV files, databases, APIs, web scraping, etc.).

Loading data into appropriate formats using Python libraries like pandas, numpy.


2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling missing values through imputation or removal.

Removing duplicate or irrelevant records.

Standardizing formats (dates, text, categorical variables).

Handling outliers and normalizing data for better analysis.


3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summarizing data with descriptive statistics.

Identifying patterns, correlations, and trends using visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn).

Detecting anomalies and distribution variations.
